# retrofit
source code for retrofit

## Usage

You can run generate.py to create a set of executables to run the experiments based on core.h, which contains the core algorithm of retrofit and compared algorithms.

Either Monte Carlo or a memory trace can be used to simulate. The Monte Carlo parameters can be modified within the generate.py file.
